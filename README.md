# Honey Cat

Red Honey Cat is a simple, easy to use honey pot that sets up what looks like is a service, but is really a honey pot on a user specified port. Originally written in BASH, Red Honey Cat is the Ruby variant I wrote for YoloCon 2016. Rainbow support is also a thing because people need it, obviously.
 
## Installation
You're going to need to install the following ruby gems for rainbow powers and other functionality:  

`gem install lolize logger`

## Usage
Quickly Setup Honey Pot

`ruby red-honey-cat.rb -p <PORT>`

Define a Custom Banner

`ruby red-honey-cat.rb -b <BANNER>`

View Help
